# express-note-tracker

This app was desgined to take an express application and make it a web page using heroku.
When you open the application you can create, edit, view and delete notes.
You edit and save notes with the buttons on the top right corner as demonstrated with the gif bellow.
and you can delete them using the trash can button.
Using the heroku open command i was able to get a weblink to my application anyone can click on.
